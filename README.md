# University-Network-Simulation
This project is a comprehensive simulation of a university campus network designed and implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It makes a very smart and essential use of Computer Networks. It aims to create an efficient and effective networking environment that facilitates communication, resource sharing, and internet access for students and faculty across various university facilities. For network security, secure shell(SSH) is also implemented for secure remote management of devices.

### Overview
This project explores the design and implementation of a wireless network within a university campus, emphasizing the importance of digital connectivity in educational institutions. The network includes various components such as routers, switches, servers, and end-user devices to support diverse functionalities like email communication, web access, and data sharing. 

### Key Features
- **Topology Design**: Implementation of a structured network topology that connects various university buildings including academic blocks, hostels, library, and IT consulting areas.
- **Device Utilization**: Incorporation of essential network devices:
  - Routers (Cisco 1941)
  - Switches (Cisco 2960-24TT)
  - Servers (DNS, Email, Web)
  - Wireless Access Points
  - PCs, Laptops, Smartphones
- **Wireless Networking**: A focus on wireless connectivity to enhance mobility and ease of access for users throughout the campus.

### Objectives
- To design a scalable and efficient university network topology.
- To implement wireless networking solutions to facilitate easy access to educational resources.
- To ensure secure connectivity through proper configuration of network devices.
